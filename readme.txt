## Note

- **Floating WhatsApp Chat Widget** can be use without WooCommerce.
- If you don't have WooCommerce plugin activated, the only setting that will appear is the **Floating WhatsApp Chat Widget** setting.
- By default, the look of **WhatsApp Order Buttons** should match the look of your WooCommerce buttons as they use the default WooCommerce button class.
- Therefore, there are no settings to customize the style of **WhatsApp Order Buttons** as there are no specific style for the buttons (I only add some inline styles to style the parent container). Feel free to customize the style using your own CSS if you need different appearance for the buttons.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WhatsApp Buttons =

Your can use multiple numbers. Number and image on line 1 will be the number and image of name in line 1, number and image on line 2 will be the number and image of name on line 2, and so on.

= Availability time =

The format is ```timezone, day(s), hour-start, hour-end```. Day start from monday (1). So if you want to set availability day is monday to friday, use 5. If it's monday to saturday, use 6.
